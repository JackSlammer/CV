  <h3>Skoolie...Really?!!!</h3>
  <p>Where have I been while this Skoolie revolution was under way! Didn't even know they existed until I stummbled across a few while looking for affordable RV's. Who knew you could take an old school bus and reinvent it into something totally cool
    and practical, then give it a wicked name like "Skoolie"!</p>

  <p>There are no Skoolie dealerships that I know of, so you have to be ready to:
    <ol>
      <li>Build your own from and old school bus you find for sale.</li>
      <li>Buy one that someone has already converted that suits yours needs</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>This subject envolves a lot of research for anyone concidering a Skoolie build. Most people I've come across through watching their videos on Youtube, on average, are taking around a year to be up and running. Now, I didn't say finished. Not
    sure I found anyone that said the word "Finished". Seems those Skoolies are are always a work in progress and as you go you find one thing after another that needs fixing or improving. </p>

  <h3>My Skill Set & How I rate Myself</h3>
  <p>Ok, this is more of a reality check. Do I have the skills to take a raw school bus and turn it into an amazing machine like you see above?
